We make our bread in small batches using authentic European baking techniques. Unlike factory breads who speed the baking process with chemicals, we ferment our bread for up to 24 hours for a delectable taste and optimal nutrients, metabolization and digestibility.\n\nWE GROW OUR OWN ORGANIC GRAINS\n\nWe bake with only premium-priced organic ingredients. All of our products are GMO free and we use nothing artificial. Ever!\n\nBREAD INSPIRED BY P.E.C. SUNFLOWERS\n\nThe sunflower fields in Prince Edward County inspired us to explore ways to grow grains locally and reduce our environmental footprint. We grow our grains in our farm in Prince Edward County. They are vegan and jam-packed with nutrients, fibre, Omega 3, protein and Vitamin D. Our goal is to have 2000 acres under contract for sustainable, GMO free, Ontario-grown grains by 2018.\n\nSTONEMILL & ONTARIO FARMERS- WE’RE LIKE 2 PEAS IN A POD.\n\nWe partner with Prince Edward County farmers for locally grown rye & spelt. This low impact transitional and organic farming partnership helps us reduce greenhouse gasses.\n\nBAKING IS NOT JUST WHAT WE DO, IT’S WHO WE ARE\n\nWe are a family bakehouse with over 100 years of European baking heritage. We use that knowledge in every loaf we bake. We are stubbornly serious about slow crafting great tasting, deliciously healthy and 100% natural breads with flavors often only found overseas.\n\nIT’S NOT EASY GOING GREEN, BUT WE KNOW IT’S WORTH IT\n\nWe are passionate about the environment and use only clean, emissions-free power generated in Ontario. By implementing our sustainability plan and using Bullfrog Power, we have reduced our emissions by almost 1,000 t Co2 every year since 2007.\n\nWe use only premium-priced organic ingredients that contribute to a reduced use of fertilizers and pesticides and sourcing clean, emissions-free power generated in Ontario. Over the past year, we have reduced our electrical consumption by 12% by retrofitting our entire bakery to conserve energy.\n\nTHE CRAFT OF BAKING SLOW\n\nWe are stubbornly serious about making slow crafted bread. In this sped-up world, we believe that better things take time. Our bread is slow crafted in small batches with absolutely no shortcuts or compromises, ever.\n\nGO SMALL OR GO HOME\n\nFactory bread is typically made in large 2000kg batches of dough using high speed mixing. This puts pressure on the bread and it is later chemically relaxed. At Stonemill, our bread is slow crafted in small 200kg batches to maintain a consistent dough temperature ensuring consistent fermentation. We allow our dough to relax naturally over time and use nothing artificial, ever.\n\nDOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP THE FACTORY OUT OF OUR BREAD.\n\nWe do everything we can to keep the factory out of our bakery. Typical factory bread is made in a high speed process, that takes as little as 3 hours, by using chemicals and/or artificial additives to reduce mixing and fermentation times and to replace moisture as their bread has lower water consumption. We ferment our dough for as long as 24 hours to create the deliciously complex flavour of our breads, making every bite even more wholesome and delicious. Fermenting our dough allows us to make breads without adding chemical additives, sugar or fat. Instead, our bread is full of nutrients and optimal for metabolization and digestibility.\n\nWE LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED\n\nUnlike factory bread that is baked in metal pans for around 30 minutes, allowing for only a thin crust to form, Stonemill bread is baked on stones using indirect heat which makes for a flavourful, caramelized crust while protecting the bread’s inner moisture.\n\n      \n      \n        Preview URL: \n        959d59ca-c108-94f5-510f-a65336e78dec\n      \n      \n        Slug: \n        text/about-us\n      \n      \n        Grid 2x2 Override: \n        false","tags":"","loc":"/text/about-us/"},
